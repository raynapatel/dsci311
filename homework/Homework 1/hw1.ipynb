My recommendation would be to find ways to increase the budget, or to optimize the forecasted budget to get more repsonses than 1500. If the budget stays at $30,000, then 4500 responses are needed to reduce the standard deviation to 1/3. But if there are ways to increase the budget slightly and increase the amount of responses at a larger amount, then that may allow it to be possible to cut the standard deviation to 1/3 of what it is now."

If the first 90 rows ordered in some way (such as time, place, demographic, etc), then the training set will train the predicitive model in a way that will reflect this bias and may not match up to the testing set. I would suggest randomly splitting up the data by shuffling first."

The evaluation process is variable and prone to error. On average, ADHD evaluation has a 20% false negative rate and a 20% false positive rate. These approximate estimates come from a [meta-analysis on adult ADHD assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422210003264?casa_token=4X4o0NmEjf0AAAAA:fTcQ4VkVh1Oz5Ze73HG5ljGac9Aiyz2rrI8hS9U27PTty9Q7DcdOMbqyNOSgX4dljNU_QDiwqDU#bib0010) (a meta-analysis is a study of studies). \n",

    "**Your response:** Underdiagnosis can be viewed as a false negative and overdiagnosis can be viewed as a false positive. If 0.03 of the US population has ADHD, that means 0.97 do not have ADHD. If 60% of those with ADHD get evaluated, then that is 0.018. 20% of these will be a false negative (0.0036) and 80% will be a true positive (0.0144). If 10% of those without ADHD get evaluted, then that is 0.097. 20% of these will be false positives (0.0194) and 80% will be a true negative (0.0776). Therefore, those that will get diagnosed with ADHD will be true positives + false positives: 0.0144 + 0.0194 = 0.0338. Those that have ADHD but aren't diagnosed will be those not evaluated + false negatives: (0.03 - 0.018) + 0.0036 = 0.0156. More than half of those who are diagnosed with ADHD (0.0194 / 0.0338 ≈ 57%) do not actually have ADHD. That means that ADHD is both underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed."

The graph starts steep, but seems to flatten out at older ages. This also makes sense with what we know about age and height. This would mean that the prediction for a 50 year old is too high."
